# PromoteAddIns
Helper script for New Outlook to promote conference call add-ins to the toolbar

This script tells New Outlook to promote WebEx and Zoom add-ins to the New Event toolbar if they are present.
This aids with feature discoverability, especially for users who are moving from classic Outlook with a plug-in to New Outlook with a web add-in.
The script sets the default state for the toolbar, but still allows users to customize it.
This script should be run on each Mac, ideally through a management agent.
